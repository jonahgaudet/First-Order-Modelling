Project: Lab1

This project uses MATLAB and Simulink to model First Order Differential equations of the form y'(t) + 1/tau * y(t) = k * x(t) as the first lab assignment for SYSC 3600: Systems and Simulations at Carleton University.

All models use the forms mentioned above. The project contains separate models for a basic first order model, delayed models, models with an initial condition, and a composite model with multiple different inputs.

In all cases, there exists scripts to run these models with case studies set within the scripts. All scripts can be run at once using the 'runPlots.m' scripts.
